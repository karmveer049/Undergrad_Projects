  <div class="page">
    You entered in my life in 2018. I still can't believe we've known each other for the past 8 years.
    I was a very rough boy, which you hated from everyone's perspective but secretly loved me.
    This thing makes me feel very special.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    The very first time you talked to me not formally was the day you scolded me for losing my chance
    to be a public speaker and said "muh me dahi jam gya hai kya".

    From that time onwards, we started talking to each other more frequently. But it still wasn't the start of anything.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    The very first spark started on 8th Feb 2020, the day of our farewell of class 10th.
    The first time we clicked pics together and the same day, we exchanged numbers.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <p><em>(Photo from 8th Feb 2020 üíë)</em></p>
    <img src="message.jpg" alt="First Photo Together">
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    This was the start of everything we are now. But still, we behaved formally ‚Äî informal formally.
    I was reckless at that time but you always stuck with me and never let me go away.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    We discussed questions and answers, but we both knew these were just tools to talk to each other
    without getting caught by parents. You met my mom for the first time at the exam center and touched her feet.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    After the exam was over, we still kept in touch. We saw various phases of life together. Highs and lows of each other.
    We‚Äôve been apartly together, fought like hell, but stuck together.
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    We'll build our house together as we planned.

    I love you, my dear. ‚ù§Ô∏è
